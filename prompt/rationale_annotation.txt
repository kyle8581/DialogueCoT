Generate rationales for generating the target utterance("Target:"). The rational consists of 3-hop subquestion-subanswer pairs.
Each question should contain commonsense relation in [oEffect, oReact, oWant, xAttr, xIntent, xNeed, xReact, xWant, isAfter, isBefore, Causes].
These rationales should be the crucial cue for generating the target utterance but you should not include the target utterance and also pretend you don't know the target utterance.
Subquestion 3 and Subanswer 3 should be about guessing the target utterance. So the Subanswer 3 should be closely related to the target utterance but don't mention it directly.
If you think generating target utterance doesn't need commonsense, then just generate None for the rationale.
